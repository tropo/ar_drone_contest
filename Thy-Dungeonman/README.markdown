# Thy-Dungeonman.rb
## A telephony port of the classic Videlectrix game, using the Tropo API.

**_You_ are Thy Dungeonman!**

[Thy Dungeonman](http://www.homestarrunner.com/dungeonman.html) is a text adventure game created in 2004 by [Videlectrix Games](http://videlectrix.com/), care of [HomestarRunner.com](http://www.homestarrunner.com/). It was created using the [Tropo API](http://tropo.com) with a [GrXML grammar](http://www.w3.org/TR/speech-grammar/) for advanced voice recognition.

This application was created as a part of a talk for the [January 2011 meeting of Austin on Rails](http://austinonrails.org/past/2011/1/9/meeting_tuesday_january_25_2010_700900_pm/). Slides are available [via SlideShare](http://www.slideshare.net/matttthompson/ring-ring-hello-oh-honey-its-for-you-yeah-i-have-the-future-on-the-line-and-it-wants-to-talk-to-you).
