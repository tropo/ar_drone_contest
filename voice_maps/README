This application allows you to create presentations for a conference, and then when looking at one, use the Comment button to leave a feedback using Phono.
Then using the Tropo hosted file it transcribes the comment, posts it back to the website so everyone can see.

Future Direction
* Better XML parsing
* Allow replay of audio instead of just showing text
* Provide AJAX page update of new comments
* Provide RSS/IRC/other streaming feed of comments
* Provide support for real phones (e.g. have to pass in the presentation id/title somehow)
